# jsPsychProduction1
A jsPsych recognition experiment examining the production effect by typing.

## Purpose

This experiment is a part of my PhD thesis. Data collected will be compared to performance of an instance-based model of human memory, MINERVA 2.

Participants were asked to study a list of words, some of which they will produce by typing, and some of which they will read silently. The study list consisted of two types of words: words that have regular pronunciations and words that have irregular pronuncialtions, with regards to spelling to sound consistency. Words were selected on the basis of norms provided by Chee et al., (2020). At test, participants will be presented with all of the words they previously studied, along with the same amount of new words that they did not study. Their job will be to indicate that yes, they did previously study a word, or no, they did not.
